"""GROW: Watermark Generation with Progressive Guidance for Diffusion Models.

A training-free, inversion-free watermarking framework for latent diffusion
models. The watermark is woven into the image during the iterative denoising
process via gradient guidance in the DCT (frequency) domain, and is recovered
directly by encoding the image back to the VAE latent and reading the signs
of the masked DCT coefficients.
